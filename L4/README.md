### Part 1.
Generator creates passwords by next rules:
1. 10% of passwords randomily taken from the most popular 100 passwords.
1. 50% of passwords randomily taken from the most popular 100K passwords.
1. 35% of passwords is generarted by modifiyng passwords from files by changing their strucute as humans do.
1. 5% of passwords is generated by randomising sequances of letters and digits.

After genereting, 100.000 passwords hashing by two alhgorithms: **MD5** and **BCrypt**. All the process is taking 16min of time.

### Part 2. 
In this part we will be recover passwords by hashes using tool **Hashcat**.Originily we got 2 files with hashes created by **MD5** and **BCrypt** alghorythms.<br><p>
To crack **MD5** hashes firtsly will use with dictionary attack using our file with 100K common passwords as dictionary and will recover 84% of passwords in like 30min.Then we will try to use bruteforce attack and got near 1% more for an hour.<br><p>
Recovering of passwords hased by **BCrypt** was not so succesful. Attacking with dictionaty type for an hour got us 4 passwords out of 100K. Bruteforce was even worse. Its because **BCrypt** hashes processing with speed of 12-7 H/s when avarage speed of recovering **MD5** was near 28000 kH/s.
